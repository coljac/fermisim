Simulates expansion of self-replicating machines in galaxy to constrain expansion parameters given non-detection.

Stochastically distributes civilisations throughout the Milky Way depending on a rate of arising between 10^-9 and 10^-6 per year. 
Then calculates the likelihood of arriving in the solar neighbourhood based on an expansion velocity (between 10^-6 and 10^-1 *c*) and the failure rate of repllications (10^-9 to 10%).
